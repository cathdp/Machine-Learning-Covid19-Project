# Final ML project Covid19

Different machine learning models were developed for covid. Scikit-learn libraries were used to train the different models and analyze the data for regression analysis. The extracted data was cleaned using Python Pandas, numpy, seaborn. The results of the predictions were plotted using Python Matplotlib. Two predictions were analyzed using the infection and recovery rate to predict the mortality rate in the US, Colombia, and Brazil. The prediction of the time period was also analyzed to predict the number of infections.
In addition, a series of data was used to create a ranking of countries by death per million.
